I learned how to Override methods, and how to design a parent class and make use of it's design for child classes.
I had trouble because I thought the due date was sunday, and not friday, so I accidentally submitted this late.
I did not include a UML class for LDUtil as it is something I made long before this project and it has thoroughly
detailed commenting. 
I did do a few extra functions for my project but those are detailed in the "BookStoreDesign" file.
In my commenting of the project I explain the use of LDUtil functions and they have javadoc which should explain
the functionality further.
